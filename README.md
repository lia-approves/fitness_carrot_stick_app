Cool that we built a fitness shaming web app at SBHACKSVI!

Inspiration: Since medical expenses are very high in California, we thought that a way to help address this is through exercise.  Our mascot is a demonic bunny because this app is definitely the "stick" and not the "carrot" method, haha

It connects to your phone or smartwatch via Strava, will ask you for the number of days 'x' you want to give yourself, and will check when you have exercised.  If you are not active after 'x' amount of days it has the power to send out a tweet on your Twitter account that you have not exercised in 'x' days.

Also known as... fooling around in OAuth hell so you can sign in to Strava, Google, and Twitter, and we also strung together a node.js / npm / GCP site.
